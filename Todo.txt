To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Change \mbox to \text to conform to specifications in Sample Article. Also make sure there is no "maths inside a text box"
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?


Afrikaans:
- Proof of Lemma id="subspace-lem" in Ch1Sec6
- Ch1Sec6 translate from line 293 and from line 606
- Ch2Sec1 translate from line 38 and from 195 and from 345



I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?
