To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Change \mbox to \text to conform to specifications in Sample Article. Also make sure there is no "maths inside a text box"
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?
- Decide whether to move Bumping Off Proposition to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- Change its name to the more standard: Steinitz Exchange Lemma or Steinitz Replacement Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz_exchange_lemma
- Give all xref's a text=""
- There is some inconsistency in using either \left[\begin{array}... or \begin{bmatrix} for matrices. For now I don't care much about this.
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)


Afrikaans:
- Proof of Lemma id="subspace-lem" in Ch1Sec6
- Ch1Sec6 translate from line 293 and from line 606
- Ch2Sec1 translate from line 38 and from 195 and from 345
- Ch2Sec2 from 104, 149, 451
- Ch2Sec3 from 116, 796, 980, 1164, 1242, 1283, 1343, 1385, 1466,



I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?
