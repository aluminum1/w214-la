To do list:

- Image sizes are inconsistent.
- Decide on and implement better colors for tikz diagrams. Use latex macros like \primaryColor etc. to ensure uniformity.
- Parts in Theorems and Proofs to (a) etc instead 1. etc. using <ol label="(a)"> (?)
- Some exercises do not have solutions yet.
- Titles for examples? and Exercises?

- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words? And many others...
- Decide whether to move Steinitz Exchange Lemma to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)
- Reconsider the use of the homemade symbol \bopen \bclose. I prefer normal parentheses (). Then the convention in Ch2Sec4 line 165 needs reconsidering too.
- Create index? And index of notation?
- Ch3Sec 3 line 6 & 25: images not allowed in text mode --- rework.
- Ch2Sec4 (in a few places actually) I commented out video on line 7. One issue with a link to a video on SunLearn is that the link will break from year to year.

Consistency and technique:
- Make sure all <proofs> are inside the <theorem> (etc.) tags and not outside (?) (low priority)
- Decide on using => and <= in proofs.


Add solutions:
- Ch3Sec5 line (1322 & 1338 add sol)


Afrikaans:
- Check that all of the following translations are consistent:
  - verify -> bevestig, nagaan?


I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section; or maybe only the exercises for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
- longer paragraphs, especially in introductions (sections can also have <conclusion>s).
- overspecified or underspecified problems
- more problems (e.g. <fillin characters=10 /> for fill in questions, like terminology)
- solutions

Ideas for problems and examples:
- Claim: Let T:V to W. Show: If T(v1) and T(v2) are linearly independent, show that v1 and v2 are
- Application: Show that sin x and cos x are lin. ind. by using the linear map T:Func to R^2 defined by T(f) = (f(0),f(pi/2)).

Use??
- <objective>?
- <outcomes>
- <reading-questions>?
- <project> or <activity> or <exploration> or <investigation>
		<introduction />
		<task />
		<conclusion />
- <worksheet>
		<objective />
		<introduction />
		<theorem />
		<figure />
		<sidebyside>
	  		<exercise width="50%" />
		</sidebyside>



- Throughout there are some figures with <caption> tags, but no text. But I think this is ok.

This can be used at the start of a section of exercises:
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Some text
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Outcomes of the exercises</title>
      <p>
      <dl>
        <li> <title>Title1</title> <p>List Item 1</p> </li>
      </dl>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
  </introduction>
