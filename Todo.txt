To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?
- Decide whether to move Bumping Off Proposition to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- Change its name to the more standard: Steinitz Exchange Lemma or Steinitz Replacement Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz_exchange_lemma
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)
- Reconsider the use of the homemade symbol \bopen \bclose. I prefer normal parentheses (). Then the convention in Ch2Sec4 line 165 needs reconsidering too.
- Rob Beezer says that CDATA should never be necessary - is it easier in a tikz picture, though? I guess you have to be careful of things like arrow heads -->
- Create index? And index of notation?
- Ch3Sec 3 line 6 & 25: images not allowed in text mode --- rework.
- Ch2Sec4 (in a few places actually) I commented out video on line 7. One issue with a link to a video on SunLearn is that the link will break from year to year.

Consistency and technique:
- There is some inconsistency in using either \left[\begin{array}... or \begin{bmatrix} for matrices. (low priority)
- nonzero vs non-zero and other (low priority)
- Consistency between \dim and \Dim?
- Make sure all <proofs> are inside the <theorem> (etc.) tags and not outside (?) (low priority)
- Change all &xea; to Ãª, etc. (low priority_)
- All phrases in 'quotes' -> <sq> or <q> (low priority)
- Make sure all LaTeX line breaks \\ are appropriate.
- Full stops after </md>, not inside the equations. (low priority)


Add solutions:
- Ch2Sec4 line (624 & 692 commented out)
- Ch3Sec5 line (1322 & 1338 add sol)


Afrikaans:
- Ch2Sec2 from 533 (but this may be the same question as in the previous section ??)
- Check that all of the following translations are consistent:
  - span (verb) -> onderspan (not span - verbs only)
  - operator (V to V) -> operator
  - operator (+) -> bewerking
  - verify -> bevestig?, nagaan?, toets?
  - respectively -> onderskeidelik


I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
- longer paragraphs, especially in introductions
- overspecified or underspecified problems

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?


- Throughout there are some figure with <caption> tags, but no text. But I think this is ok.
