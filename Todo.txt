To do list:

- Image sizes are inconsistent.
- Decide on and implement better colors for tikz diagrams. Use latex macros like \primaryColor etc. to ensure uniformity.
- Do we want to use the Stellenbosch University Brand Colors? If so, here they are
  - brand-maroon: #60223b, RGB(140, 151, 154)
  - brand-gray: #8c979a, RGB(96,34,59)
  - brand-gold: #967140, RGB(150,113,64)
- Write Python script to change link to Mathjax to the local one on SunLearn and the links to the pretext css files to local versions. Make sure they are available locally, and build in a test for updates. Make sure to test it! Robert Beezer discourages this in the
- Parts in Theorems and Proofs to (a) etc instead 1. etc. using <ol label="(a)"> (?) [Prop 2.2.8]
- Some exercises do not have solutions yet.
- Titles for examples? and Exercises?
- See if there are any lists (<ol> or <ul>) that can be improved by placing items in columns using the attrbiute @cols="2" or @cols="3".

- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words? And many others...
- Decide whether to move Steinitz Exchange Lemma to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)
- Reconsider the use of the homemade symbol \bopen \bclose. I prefer normal parentheses (). Then the convention in Ch2Sec4 line 165 needs reconsidering too.
- Create index? And index of notation?
- Ch3Sec 3 line 6 & 25: images not allowed in text mode --- rework.
- Ch2Sec4 (in a few places actually) I commented out video on line 7. One issue with a link to a video on SunLearn is that the link will break from year to year.

Consistency and technique:
- Make sure all <proofs> are inside the <theorem> (etc.) tags and not outside (?) (low priority)
- Decide on using => and <= in proofs.


Add solutions:
- Ch3Sec5 line (1322 & 1338 add sol)


Afrikaans:
- Check that all of the following translations are consistent:
  - verify -> bevestig, nagaan?


I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section; or maybe only the exercises for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
- longer paragraphs, especially in introductions (sections can also have <conclusion>s and <references> to other reading and/or Youtube Videos).
- overspecified or underspecified problems
- more problems (e.g. <fillin characters=10 /> for fill in questions, like terminology)
- solutions

Ideas for problems and examples:
- Claim: Let T:V to W. Show: If T(v1) and T(v2) are linearly independent, show that v1 and v2 are -  already in !
- Application: Show that sin x and cos x are lin. ind. by using the linear map T:Func to R^2 defined by T(f) = (f(0),f(pi/2)).
- Rank-Nullity Theorem to show the rank theorem from 144: #free + #non-0 rows = #columns
- Sometimes go back and show how new "technology" can help you better understand previous problems.

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?
- <project> or <activity> or <exploration> or <investigation>
		<introduction />
		<task />
		<conclusion />
- <worksheet>
		<objective />
		<introduction />
		<theorem />
		<figure />
		<sidebyside>
	  		<exercise width="50%" />
		</sidebyside>



- Throughout there are some figures with <caption> tags, but no text. But I think this is ok.

Put pdf publisher settings (and environment customizations) in the file /xsl/w214-latex.xsl and use the following to compile to Latex:
xsltproc --xinclude xsl/w214-latex.xsl ptx/W214-Lin-Alg.ptx > %OUTPUT_FILE
