To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?
- Decide whether to move Bumping Off Proposition to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- Change its name to the more standard: Steinitz Exchange Lemma or Steinitz Replacement Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz_exchange_lemma
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)
- Reconsider the use of the homemade symbol \bopen \bclose. I prefer normal parentheses (). Then the assemblage in Ch2Sec4 line 165 needs reconsidering too.
- Rob Beezer says that CDATA should never be necessary - is it easier in a tikz picture, though? I guess you have to be careful of things like arrow heads -->
- Create index?
- Ch3Sec 3 line 6 & 25: images not allowed in text mode --- rework.
- Ch2Sec4 (in a few places actually) I commented out video on line 7. One issue with a link to a video on SunLearn is that the link will break from year to year.

Consistency and technique:
- Replace cmatrix and cvector with \begin{bmatrix}
- There is some inconsistency in using either \left[\begin{array}... or \begin{bmatrix} for matrices. For now I don't care much about this.
- nonzero vs non-zero and other
- Consistency between \dim and \Dim?
- Make sure all <proofs> are inside the <result> tags and not outside (?)
- Change \mbox to \text to conform to specifications in Sample Article. Also make sure there is no "maths inside a text box"
- Change all &xea; to Ãª, etc.
- All phrases in 'quotes' -> <sq> or <q>


Afrikaans:
- Proof of Lemma id="subspace-lem" in Ch1Sec6, line 95
- Ch1Sec6 translate from line 293 and from line 606
- Ch2Sec1 translate from line 38 and from 195 and from 345
- Ch2Sec2 from 104, 149, 451
- Ch2Sec3 from 116, 796, 980, 1164, 1242, 1283, 1343, 1385, 1466,
- Ch2Sec4 Proposition on line 12 still has different versions for Eng and Afr.
- Ch2Sec4 line 265, 440, 499, 561, (624 & 692 commented out), 750
- Ch2Sec5 line 436
- Ch3Sec1 line 354, 419, 512, 676 (rework to use linear combination instead of coordinate vectors), 875, 973, 1217
- Ch3Sec3 line 471, 526,
- Ch3Sec4 line 296, 481
- Ch3Sec5 line 943, 1071, 1174, (1322 & 1338 add sol)
- Check that all of the following are consistent:
  - span (verb) -> onderspan (not span - verbs only)
  - operator (V to V) -> operator
  - operator (+) -> bewerking
  - verify -> bevestig?, nagaan?, toets?


I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
- longer paragraph, especially in introductions

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?


- Throughout there are some figure with <caption> tags, but no text.
