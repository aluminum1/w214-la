To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Change \mbox to \text to conform to specifications in Sample Article. Also make sure there is no "maths inside a text box"
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?
- Decide whether to move Bumping Off Proposition to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- Also, what is its relation to the Steinitz Replacement Theorem, which may be a more standard name?


Afrikaans:
- Proof of Lemma id="subspace-lem" in Ch1Sec6
- Ch1Sec6 translate from line 293 and from line 606
- Ch2Sec1 translate from line 38 and from 195 and from 345
- Ch2Sec2 from 104, 149, 451



I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.

Use??
- <objective>?
- <reading-questions>?
