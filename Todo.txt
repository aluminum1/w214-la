To do list:

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \fun{} that can be changed in one place?
- Change \mbox 'es to \text to conform to specifications in Sample Article. Also make sure there is no "maths inside a text box"
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words?



Afrikaans:
- Checkpoint 1.4.15 has broken link
- In Oefening 1.4.1.2, the link to 1.4.1.1 doesn't display the knowl
  

I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
