To do list:

- Image sizes are inconsistent.
- Decide on and implement better colors for tikz diagrams. Use latex macros like \primaryColor etc. to ensure uniformity.
- Parts in Theorems and Proofs to (a) etc instead 1. etc. using <ol label="(a)"> (?)
- It seems that <xref>s in displayed equations should not be placed inside \text{}.
- Some exercises do not have solutions yet.
- Titles for examples? and Exercises?

- In 1.4 the English denotes functions f while Afrikaans does \mathbf{f}. Perhaps use a macro \funcVec{} that can be changed in one place?
- Can the first two lemmas in 1.5 be written using more words? And many others...
- Decide whether to move Steinitz Exchange Lemma to section on bases where it can be explained that its relevance is to show that two bases have the same size.
- First person to first person plural? (I to we)
- Reconsider the use of the homemade symbol \bopen \bclose. I prefer normal parentheses (). Then the convention in Ch2Sec4 line 165 needs reconsidering too.
- Create index? And index of notation?
- Ch3Sec 3 line 6 & 25: images not allowed in text mode --- rework.
- Ch2Sec4 (in a few places actually) I commented out video on line 7. One issue with a link to a video on SunLearn is that the link will break from year to year.

Consistency and technique:
- Make sure all <proofs> are inside the <theorem> (etc.) tags and not outside (?) (low priority)
- Full stops after </md>, not inside the equations. (low priority)
- Decide on using => and <= in proofs.


Add solutions:
- Ch2Sec4 line (624 & 692 commented out)
- Ch3Sec5 line (1322 & 1338 add sol)


Afrikaans:
- Ch2Sec2 from 533 (but this may be the same question as in the previous section ??)
- Check that all of the following translations are consistent:
  - span (verb) -> onderspan (not span - verbs only)
  - operator (V to V) -> operator
  - operator (+) -> bewerking
  - verify -> bevestig, nagaan?, toets?
  - respectively -> onderskeidelik


I would like to add
- learning outcomes for each section
- link exercises or groups of exercises to these learning outcomes.
- longer paragraphs, especially in introductions
- overspecified or underspecified problems
- more problems
- solutions

Use??
- <objective>?
- <outcomes>
- <reading-questions>?


- Throughout there are some figures with <caption> tags, but no text. But I think this is ok.
