This is a file where some conventions and shortcuts are kept for authors in these documents as well as some things to keep in mind to make PreTeXt work:

** Rob Beezer's advice when writing
Read this page (https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/advice-math-textbook.html) every once in a while...

** PreTeXt THINGS:
*** XREFS
- See Table 4.6.5 on https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/topic-cross-referencing.html for more
- Rob Beezer suggest that xrefs's are written in kebab case or snake case like this: isom_iff_inj_and_surj. I don't think all our xref's are like that, but I don't suggest we go and change them all unless we get into trouble when compiling.

*** OTHER
- Inside maths, use only \text{} to write text, not \mbox{}
- Don't write any maths inside \text{}; rather use more \text{}s
- <q> for "quotes" and <sq> for 'single quotes'
- Don't use <, > and & except for their intended special purposes (< and > open tags, & is used to indicate a special character follows, like &#xea; for ê - but you can use ê instead!). Instead use &lt; &gt; and &amp; when in text mode and \amp, \lt, \gt in math mode.
- Use also: <ellipsis/>, <ndash/>, <mdash/>, <fillin/>
- <sage> Don't know - see what Bruce did
- <idx> for index element??
- <notation> <usage> Z(G) </usage> <description> Center of a group </de... (or maybe switch <usage> and <description>??)
- <url href=""> for external refs
- See https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/overview-si-units.html if you want to use SI units



- See https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/topic-exercises-solutions.html for details on changing visibility of Solutions to exercises.

- For images: <figure> <image width="**%" source="*""> <\image> <caption> </caption> </figure>

- Tables: <table> <tabular> <tr> <td>

- See https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/processing-testing-html.html to use Python to create an http webserver that can be used to test your html output (just opening the file in a browser will not work perfectly, especially when it needs to render a knowl)

- Project like environments:
  - <project>
  - <activity>
  - <exploration>
  - <investigation>
  - Include:
    - <title>
    - <introduction>
    - <task>
    - <conclusion>


** NOTATIONS:
vectors:				    \ve{v}
scalar product:			\smul




** GLOSSARY (for translation):

well-defined		  wel-gedefinieerd
summation			    optelling (rather than sommering)
spanned (verb)		onderspan
