  <p>
    You are about to meet linear algebra for the second time.
    In the first year, we focused on systems of linear equations,
    matrices, and their determinants.
    That was good and well,
    but the time has come for you to return to these topics from a more abstract,
    mathematical viewpoint.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should not be scared by <em>abstraction</em>.
    It simply means getting rid of extraneous detail and limiting oneself exclusively to the most important features of a problem.
    This allows you to understand the problem better.
    There are less things to worry about!
    Moreover, if you encounter another problem,
    which is superficially different but shares the same important features as the original problem,
    then you could understand it in the same way.
    This is the power of abstraction.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we study abstract mathematics,
    we use the language of <em>definitions</em>,
    <em>theorems</em> and <em>proofs</em>.
    Learning to think along these lines
    (developing abstract mathematical thinking)
    can be a daunting task at first.
    But keep trying.
    One day it will <sq>click</sq> into place and you will realize it is all much more simple than you had first imagined.
  </p>

  <p>
    You cannot read mathematics the way you read a novel.
    You need to have a <em>pencil and notepad</em> with you,
    and you need to actively <em>engage</em> with the material.
    For instance, if you encounter a definition,
    start by writing down the definition on your notepad.
    Just the act of writing it out can be therapeutic!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you encounter a worked example,
    try to write out the example yourself.
    Perhaps the example is trying to show that <m>A</m> equals <m>B</m>.
    Start by asking yourself: Do I understand what <sq><m>A</m></sq> actually means?
    Do I understand what <sq><m>B</m></sq> actually means?
    Only then are you ready to consider the question of whether <m>A</m> is equal to <m>B</m> !
  </p>

  <p>
    Good luck in this new phase of your mathematical training.
    Enjoy the ride!
