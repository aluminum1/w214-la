    <title>Three different sets</title>
    <p>
      We start by playing a game.
      Recall that in mathematics,
      a <em>set</em> <m>X</m> is just a collection of distinct objects.
      We call these objects the <em>elements</em> of <m>X</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am going to show you three different sets,
      and you need to tell me the properties that they all have in common.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first set, <m>A</m>,
      is defined to be the set of all ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <p>
        Let us pause for a second and translate this definition from English into mathematical symbols.
        The translation is:
        <men>
          A := \{ (a_1,\, a_2) : a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{R}  \} 
        </men>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <m>:=</m> stands for <sq>is defined to be</sq>.
        The <m>\{</m> and <m>\}</m> symbols stand for <sq>the set of all</sq>.
        The lone colon <m>:</m> stands for <sq>where</sq> or <sq>such that</sq>.
        The comma in between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> stands for <sq>and</sq>.
        The <m>\in</m> stands for <sq>an element of</sq>.
        And <m>\mathbb{R}</m> stands for the set of all real numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well done <mdash /> you are learning the language of mathematics!
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      An element of <m>A</m> is an arbitrary pair of real numbers <m>\ve{a} = (a_1, \, a_2)</m>.
      For instance, <m>(1, \, 2) \in A</m> and
      <m>(3.891, \, e^\pi)</m> are elements of <m>A</m>.
      Note also that I am using a boldface <m>\ve{a}</m> to refer to an element of <m>A</m>.
      This is so that we can distinguish <m>\ve{a}</m> from its <em>components</em>
      <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_2</m>,
      which are just ordinary numbers
      (not elements of <m>A</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      We can visualize an element <m>\ve{a}</m> of <m>A</m> as a point in the Cartesian plane whose <m>x</m>-coordinate is <m>a_1</m> and whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is <m>a_2</m>:

    <p>
      The second set, <m>B</m>,
      is defined to be the set of all ordered real triples
      <m>(b_1, \, b_2, \, b_3)</m> satisfying <m>b_1 - b_2 + b_3 = 0</m>.
      Translated into mathematical symbols,
      <men>
        B := \{ (b_1, \, b_2, \, b_3) : b_1, b_2, b_3 \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ and }  b_1 - b_2 + b_3 = 0\} 
      </men>.

    <p>
      For instance, <m>(2,3, 1) \in B</m> but <m>(1,1,1) \notin B</m>.
      We can visualize an element <m>\ve{b}</m> of <m>B</m> as a point in the plane in 3-dimensional space carved out by the equation <m>x-y+z = 0</m>:

    <p>
      The third set,
      <m>C</m>, is the set of all polynomials of degree 4.
      Translated into mathematical symbols,
      <men>
        C := \{ \mbox{polynomials of degree \(\leq 4\)} \}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that the <em>degree</em>
      of a polynomial is the highest power of <m>x</m> which occurs.
      For instance,
      <m>\ve{c} = x^4 - 3 x^3 + 2x^2</m> is a polynomial of degree 4, and so is <m>\ve{p} = 2x^3 + \pi x</m>.
      So <m>\ve{c}</m> and <m>\ve{p}</m> are elements of <m>C</m>.
      But <m>\ve{r} = 8x^5 - 7</m> and
      <m>\ve{s} = \sin(x)</m> are not elements of <m>C</m>.
      We can visualize an element
      <m>\ve{c} \in C</m> (i.e. a polynomial of degree 4) via its <em>graph</em>.
      For instance, the polynomial
      <m>\ve{c} = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x^2 \in C</m> can be visualized as:
      <sidebyside valign="middle" margins="20% 40%">

      There you have it.
      I have defined three different sets:
      <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>,
      and I have explained how to visualize the elements of each of these sets.
      On the face of it, the sets are quite different.
      Elements of <m>A</m> are arbitrary points in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
      Elements of <m>B</m> are points in
      <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> satisfying a certain equation.
      Elements of <m>C</m> are polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      What features do these sets have in common?

    <title>Features the sets have in common</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        I want to focus on two features that the sets <m>A</m>,
        <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have in common.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Addition</title>
      <p>
        Firstly, in each of these sets,
        there is a natural <em>addition operation</em>.
        We can add two elements of the set to get a third element.
      </p>

      <p>
        In set <m>A</m>,
        we can add two elements <m>\ve{a} = (a_1, \, a_2)</m> and
        <m>\ve{a}' = (a_1', \, a_2')</m> together by adding their components together,
        to form a new element <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}' \in A</m>:
        <men xml:id="add_in_A">
          \underbrace{(a_1, \, a_2)}_{\ve{a}} + \underbrace{(a'_1, \,a'_2)}_{\ve{a}'} := \underbrace{(a_1 + a_1', \, a_2 + a_2')}_{\ve{a} + \ve{a}'}
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, <m>(1, \,3) + (2, \,-1.6) = (3, \,1.4)</m>.
        We can visualize this addition operation as follows:

      <p>
        We can do a similar thing in set <m>B</m>.
        Suppose we have two elements of <m>B</m>,
        <m>\ve{b} = (b_1, \,b_2, \,b_3)</m> and <m>\ve{b}' = (b_1', \, b_2', \, b_3')</m>.
        Note that, since <m>\ve{b}\in B</m>,
        its components satisfy <m>b_1 - b_2 + b_3 = 0</m>.
        Similarly the components of <m>b'</m> satisfy and <m>b_1 - b_2 + b_3 = 0</m>.
        We can add <m>\ve{b}</m> and <m>\ve{b}'</m> together to get a new element <m>\ve{b} + \ve{b}'</m> of <m>B</m>,
        by adding their components together as before:
        <men xml:id="new_add_in_B">
          \underbrace{(b_1, \, b_2, \, b_3)}_{\ve{b}} + \underbrace{(b'_1, \,b'_2, \, b'_3)}_{\ve{b}'} := \underbrace{(b_1 + b_1', \, b_2 + b_2', \, b_3 + b'_3)}_{\ve{b} + \ve{b}'}
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        We should be careful here.
        How do we know that the expression on the right hand side is really an element of <m>B</m>?
        We need to check that it satisfies the equation <sq>the first component minus the second component plus the third component equals zero</sq>.
        Let us check that formally:
        <md>
          <mrow>(\ve{b} + \ve{b}')_1 - (\ve{b}+\ve{b}')_2 + (\ve{b}+\ve{b}')_3 \amp = (b_1 + b'_1) - (b_2 + b'_2) + (b_3 + b'_3)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = (b_1 - b_2 + b_3) + (b'_1 - b'_2 + b'_3)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 0 + 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 0</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can visualize this addition operation in <m>B</m> in the same way as we did for <m>A</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also an addition operation in set <m>C</m>.
        We can add two polynomials together algebraically by adding their corresponding coefficients:
        <mdn>
         <mrow number="no">[c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x^1 + c_0] + [d_4 x^4 + d_3 x^3 + d_2 x^2 + d_1 x^1 + d_0]</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="add_in_C">:= (c_4 + d_4) x^4 + (c_3 + d_3) x^3 + (c_2 + d_2) x^2 + (c_1 + d_1) x^1 + (c_0 + d_0)</mrow>
        </mdn>
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance,
        <me>
          [2x^4  + x^2 - 3x + 2] + [2x^3 - 7x^2 + x] 
          = 2x^4 + 2x^3 - 6x^2 -2x + 2
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is another way to think about the addition of polynomials.
        Each polynomial <m>\ve{c}</m> can be thought of as a <em>function</em>,
        in the sense that we can substitute an arbitrary value of <m>x</m> into the polynomial <m>\ve{c}</m>,
        and it will output a number <m>\ve{c}(x)</m>.
        For instance, if <m>\ve{c}(x) = 3x^2 - 1</m>,
        then <m>\ve{c}(2) = 11</m>.
        If we think of polynomials as functions in this way,
        then the addition <m>\ve{c} + \ve{d}</m> of two polynomials can be thought of as the new function which,
        when you substitute some number <m>x</m> into it,
        outputs <m>\ve{c}(x) + \ve{d}(x)</m>.
        Written mathematically,
        <men xml:id="add_in_C2">
          (\ve{c} + \ve{d})(x) := \ve{c}(x) + \ve{d}(x)
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking in this way, we can visualize the graph of
        <m>\ve{c} + \ve{d}</m> as the graph of <m>\ve{c}</m> added to the graph of <m>\ve{d}</m>:

        When you add this point to another point <m>(a_1, \, a_2) \in A</m>,
        nothing happens!

        Do not confuse the zero element
        <m>\ve{0} \in A</m> with the real number zero, <m>0 \in \mathbb{R}</m>.
        This is another reason why I am using boldface! (You should use underline to distinguish them.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In <m>B</m>,
        the zero element <m>\ve{0}</m> is the point <m>(0,0,0) \in B</m>.

      </p>

      <p>
        In <m>C</m>, the zero element <m>\ve{0}</m> is the
        <em>zero polynomial</em>.
        If we think algebraically,
        this is the degree polynomial whose coefficients are all zero:
        <men xml:id="zero_in_C">
          \ve{0} = 0 x^4 + 0 x^3 + 0 x^2 + 0 x + 0
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        If we think of the polynomial as a function,
        then the zero polynomial <m>\ve{0}</m> is the function which returns zero for all values of <m>x</m>,
        that is <m>\ve{0} (x) = 0</m> for all <m>x</m>.
        Whichever way we think of it,
        when we add the zero polynomial to another polynomial,
        nothing happens!

      <title>Multiplication by scalars</title>
      <p>
        The last feature all the sets <m>A</m>,
        <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have in common is that in each set,
        you can <em>multiply</em> elements of the set by real numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance,
        if <m>\ve{a} = (a_1, a_2)</m> is an element of <m>A</m>,
        then we can multiply it by some arbitrary real number,
        say <m>9</m>, to get a new element <m>9\smul \ve{a}</m> of <m>A</m>.
        We do this multiplication component-wise:
        <men xml:id="sm_in_A">
          9 \smul(a_1, \,a_2) := (9 a_1, \, 9a_2)
        </men>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, if <m>k \in \mathbb{R}</m> is an arbitrary real number,
        then we can multiply elements
        <m>\ve{a} \in A</m> by <m>k</m> to get a new element
        <m>k \smul\ve{a} \in A</m> by multiplying each component of <m>\ve{a}</m> by <m>k</m>:
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, if <m>k \in \mathbb{R}</m> is an arbitrary real number,
        then we can multiply elements
        <m>\ve{a} \in A</m> by <m>k</m> to get a new element
        <m>k \smul\ve{a} \in A</m> by multiplying each component of <m>\ve{a}</m> by <m>k</m>:
        <me>
          \underbrace{k \smul(a_1, \, a_2)}_{\text{ Multiplying a vector by a scalar} } := (\underbrace{k a_1}_{\text{Multiplying two numbers together} }, \, \underbrace{k a_2})
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Just be careful to distinguish scalar multiplication <m>k \smul\ve{a}</m>
        (written with a <m>\smul</m>)
        from ordinary multiplication of real numbers <m>k a_1</m>
        (written with no symbol, just using juxtaposition).
        Later on, because we are lazy,
        we will stop writing the <m>\cdot</m> explicitly <mdash /> you have been warned!
      </p>

      <p>
        Visually, this multiplcation operation <em>scales</em>
        <m>\ve{a}</m> by a factor of <m>k</m>.
        That is why we call it <em>scalar multiplication</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a similar scalar multiplication in <m>B</m>:
        <men xml:id="sm_in_B">
          k (u_1, \, u_2, \, u_3) := (k u_1, \, k u_2, \, k u_3)
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also a scalar multiplication operation in <m>C</m>.
        We simply multiply each coefficient of a polynomial <m>\ve{c} \in C</m> by <m>k</m>:
        <men xml:id="sm_in_C">
          k \smul[c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0] = k c_4 x^4 + k c_3 x^3 + k c_2 x^2 + k c_1 x + k c_0
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        If we think of the polynomial <m>\ve{c}</m> as a function,
        then this corresponds to <em>scaling</em>
        the graph of the function vertically by a factor of <m>k</m>.
      </p>

    <title>Features that the sets do <em>not</em> have</title>
    <p>
      Let us mention a few features that the sets do <em>not</em> have,
      or at least do not have in common.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Set <m>A = \mathbb{R}^2</m> has a
            <em>multiplication operation</em>.
            Because we can think of <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> as the complex plane <m>\mathbb{C}</m>,
            and we know how to multiply complex numbers.
            There is no clear choice of a multiplication operation on <m>B</m>.
            The same for <m>C</m>:
            if you try to multiply two degree <m>4</m> polynomials in <m>C</m> together,
            you will get out a polynomial of degree <m>8</m>,
            which does not live in <m>C</m>!
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            There is a <em><sq>take the derivative</sq></em> operation on <m>C</m>,
            <me>
              \ve{c} \mapsto \frac{d}{dx} \ve{c}
            </me>
            which we will meet again later.
            Note that taking the derivative decreases the degree of a polynomial by 1, so the result remains in <m>C</m>,
            and so this is a well defined map from <m>C</m> to <m>C</m>.
            There is no analogue of this operation in <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

            <assemblage>
              <p>
                Note that there is no <em>integration</em>
                map from <m>C</m> to <m>C</m>,
                because integrating a polynomial
                <em>increases</em> the degree by <m>1</m>,
                so the result might be a polynomial of degree <m>5</m>,
                which does not live in <m>C</m>!
              </p>
            </assemblage>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Rules</title>
    <p>
      We have found that each of our three sets <m>A</m>,
      <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have an <em>addition operation</em> <m>+</m>,
      a <em>zero vector</em> <m>\ve{0}</m>,
      and a <em>scalar multiplication</em> operation <m>\cdot</m>.
      Do these operations satisfy any rules, common to all three sets?
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance,
      we can think of the addition operation in <m>A</m> as a function which assigns to each pair of elements <m>\ve{a}</m> and <m>\ve{a}'</m> in <m>A</m> a new element <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}'</m> in <m>A</m>.
      Does this operation satisfy any rules?
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us see.
      Let <m>\ve{a} = (a_1, \,a_2)</m> and
      <m>\ve{a}' = (a'_1, \, a'_2)</m> be elements of <m>A</m>.
      We can add them in two different orders,
      <me>
        \ve{a} + \ve{a}' = (a_1 + a'_1, \, a_2 + a'_2)
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \ve{a}' + \ve{a} = (a'_1 + a_1, \, a'_2 + a_2) 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Are these the same?
      In other words, does the rule
      <men xml:id="comm_in_A">
        \ve{a} + \ve{a}' = \ve{a}' + \ve{a}
      </men>
      hold?
      The answer is <em>yes</em>, but why?
      To check whether two elements of <m>A</m> are equal,
      we have to check whether each of their components are equal.
      The first component of <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}'</m> is <m>a_1 + a'_1</m>.
      The first component of <m>\ve{a}' + \ve{a}</m> is <m>a'_1 + a_1</m>.
      Is <m>a_1 + a'_1 = a'_1 + a_1</m>?
      Yes <mdash /> because these are just ordinary real numbers
      (not elements of <m>A</m> anymore),
      and we know that for ordinary real numbers,
      you can add them together in either order and get the same result.
      So the first component of <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}'</m> is equal to the first component of <m>a'+ a</m>.
      Similarly, we can check that the second component of
      <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}'</m> is equal to the second component of <m>\ve{a}' + \ve{a}</m>.
      So all the components of <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}'</m> are equal to all the components of <m>\ve{a}' + \ve{a}</m>.
      So, finally,
      we conclude that <m>\ve{a} + \ve{a}' = \ve{a}' + \ve{a}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Does this rule <xref ref="comm_in_A" /> also hold for the addition operations in <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>?
      Yes.
      For instance, let us check that it holds in <m>C</m>.
      Suppose that <m>\ve{c}</m> and <m>\ve{d}</m> are polynomials in <m>C</m>.
      Does the rule
      <men xml:id="must_check">
        \ve{c} + \ve{d} = \ve{d} + \ve{c}
      </men>
      hold?
    </p>

    <p>
      The left and right hand sides of <xref ref="must_check" /> are elements of <m>C</m>.
      And elements of <m>C</m> are polynomials.
      To check if two polynomials are equal,
      we need to check if they are equal
      <em>as functions</em>, in other words,
      if you get identical results output from both functions no matter what input value of <m>x</m> you substitute in.
    </p>

    <p>
      At an arbitrary input value <m>x</m>,
      the left hand side computes as <m>(\ve{c} + \ve{d})(x) = \ve{c}(x) + \ve{d}(x)</m>.
      On the other hand,
      the right hand side computes as <m>(\ve{d} + \ve{c})(x) = \ve{d}(x) + \ve{c}(x)</m>.
      Now, remember that <m>\ve{c}(x)</m> and
      <m>\ve{d}(x)</m> are just ordinary numbers
      (not polynomials).
      So <m>\ve{c}(x) + \ve{d}(x) = \ve{d}(x) + \ve{c}(x)</m>,
      because this is true for ordinary numbers.
      So for each input value <m>x</m>,
      <m>(\ve{c} + \ve{d}) (x) = (\ve{d} + \ve{c})(x)</m>.
      Therefore the polynomials <m>\ve{c} + \ve{d}</m> and <m>\ve{d} + \ve{c}</m> are equal,
      because they output the same values for all numbers <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are other rules that also hold in all three sets.
      For instance, in all three sets, the rule
      <men>
        (\ve{x} + \ve{y}) + \ve{z} = \ve{x} + (\ve{y} + \ve{z})
      </men>
      holds for any three elements <m>\ve{x}</m>,
      <m>\ve{y}</m> and <m>\ve{z}</m>.
      Can you find the other common rules?
    </p>
