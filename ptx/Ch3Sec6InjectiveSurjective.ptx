      <p>
        A function <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m> from a set <m>X</m> to a set <m>Y</m> is called <term>one-to-one</term>
        (or <term>injective</term>)
        if whenever <m>f(x) = f(x')</m> for some
        <m>x, x' \in X</m> it necessarily holds that <m>x = x'</m>.
        The function <m>f</m> is called <term>onto</term>
        (or <term>surjective</term>)
        if for all <m>y \in Y</m> there exists an <m>x \in X</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    If <m>f</m> is a <em>linear map</em> between vector spaces
    (and not just an arbitrary function between sets),
    there is a simple way to check if <m>f</m> is injective.
  </p>

  <lemma xml:id="injective-kernel-lemma">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : V \rightarrow W</m> be a linear map between vector spaces.
        Then <m>T</m> is injective if and only if
        <me>
          \Ker(T) = \{\ve{0}_V\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
  <case direction="forward">
    <p>
      Suppose <m>T : V \rightarrow W</m> is one-to-one.
      We already know one element in <m>\Ker(T)</m>, namely <m>\ve{0}_V</m>,
      since <m>T(\ve{0}_V) = \ve{0}_W</m> as <m>T</m> is linear.
      Since <m>T</m> is one-to-one,
      this must be the only element in <m>\Ker(T)</m>.
    </p>
  </case>

  <case direction="backward">
    <p>
      Suppose <m>\Ker(T) = \{\ve{0}_V\}</m> and that
      <me>
        T(\ve{v}) = T(\ve{v}')
      </me>
      for some vectors <m>\ve{v}, \ve{v}' \in V</m>.
      Then we have <m>T(\ve{v}) - T(\ve{v}') = \ve{0}_W</m>,
      and since <m>T</m> is linear,
      this means <m>T(\ve{v} - \ve{v}') = \ve{0}_W</m>.
      Hence <m>\ve{v} - \ve{v}' \in \Ker(T)</m>,
      and so <m>\ve{v} - \ve{v}' = \ve{0}_V</m>,
      in other words, <m>\ve{v} = \ve{v}'</m>,
      which is what we wanted to show.
    </p>
  </case>
  </proof>
</lemma>

  <p>
    Another simplification occurs if <m>T</m> is a linear map from a vector space <m>V</m> to itself (i.e.
    <m>T</m> is a linear operator on <m>V</m>),
    and <m>V</m> is finite-dimensional.

        A linear map <m>T : V \rightarrow W</m> is an isomorphism if and only if <m>T</m> is injective and surjective.

      Suppose <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are isomorphic.
      That is, there exists a pair of linear maps <m>T : V\rightleftarrows W : S</m> such that

      which shows that <m>T</m> is injective.

      We must show that there exists

      Indeed, set <m>\ve{v} := S(\ve{w})</m>.
      Then

      Suppose that there exists a linear map
      <m>T : V \rightarrow W</m> which is injective and surjective.
      We will show that there exists a linear map <m>S : W \rightarrow V</m> such that
      <m>S \circ T = \id_V</m> and <m>T \circ S = \id_W</m>,

    <p>
      We define the inverse map <m>S</m> as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>S : W \amp  \rightarrow V</mrow>
        <mrow>\ve{w} \amp  \mapsto \text{the unique } \ve{v} \in V \text{ such that } T(\ve{v}) = \ve{w}.</mrow>

    </p>

    <p>
      This map is well-defined.
      Indeed, given <m>\ve{w} \in W</m>,
      the fact that <m>T</m> is surjective means there does exist <em>some</em>
      <m>\ve{v} \in V</m> such that <m>T(\ve{v}) = \ve{w}</m>.
      The fact that <m>T</m> is injective implies that this <m>\ve{v}</m> is unique.
      For if there exists another
      <m>\ve{v}' \in V</m> with <m>S(\ve{v}') = \ve{w}</m>,
      then we have <m>\ve{v}' = \ve{v}</m> since <m>T</m> is injective.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point we have a well-defined <em>function</em>
      <m>S : W \rightarrow V</m> which satisfies
      <m>T \circ S = \id_W</m> and <m>S \circ T = \id_V</m>.
      We only need to check that <m>S</m> is linear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>\ve{w}_1, \ve{w}_2 \in W</m>.
      Then
      <md>
        <mrow>S( a \ve{w}_1 + b \ve{w}_2) \amp = S\big(a T(S(\ve{w}_1)) + b T(S(\ve{w}_2)) \big) \amp \amp  (\text{using } T \circ S = \id_W )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = S\big( a T(\ve{v}_1) + b T(\ve{v}_2) \big) \amp \amp \left(\text{setting }  \ve{v}_1 := S(\ve{w}_1),
        \ve{v}_2 := S(\ve{w}_2)) \right) </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = S\big(T(a \ve{v}_1 + b \ve{v}_2)\big) \amp \amp  (T \text{ is linear})</mrow>

      Hence <m>S</m> is linear, which completes the proof.

          Since the nullity is 0 we can say that <m>T</m> is injective, but nothing about whether it is surjective, since we don't know <m>\Dim(W)</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>T</m> is not injective, since the nullity is greater than 0. But we can compute the rank to be <m>\Dim V- \Nullity(T) = 5-2 =3</m>, which is the same as <m>\Dim W</m>. Thus <m>T</m> is surjective.

        <li>
          We cannot say anything about surjectivity. But we know the nullity is <m>3-2=1</m>, which is greater than 0. So definitely <m>T</m> is not injective.

        <li>
          The nullity is 0, so <m>T</m> is injective, but we don't know the rank and can't compute it since we also don't know <m>\Dim V</m>. Thus nothing can be said about surjectivity.

        <li>
          We have <m>\Rank\le \Dim W \lt \Dim V</m> and thus <m>\Nullity \gt 0</m>. Thus <m>T</m> is not injective. We can't say anything about surjectivity. (E.g. the zero map is not surjective, but something like a projection onto a smaller subspace is surjective.)
