<exercise> <statement> <p>Read through the webpage version of <xref ref="Ch2Sec1LinearCombinationSpan"/>. I have added some new material, and gave examples of how to use SageMath to solve systems of linear equations. </p></statement></exercise>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-span-omission">
    <statement> Let <m>\basis{S} = \bopen \ve{v}_1, \ldots, \ve{v}_n \bclose </m> be a list of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m>. Suppose that <m>\basis{S}</m> spans <m>V</m>.

<exercise> <statement><p> Go through the same steps as in <xref ref="app_of_prop_preceding">Example</xref>
        to find the first vector in the list which is either the zero vector or a linear combination of the preceding vectors. You are welcome to use SageMath at the points in your calculation when you need to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations.</p>
