      In this section we will introduce the notion of a <em>subspace</em> of a vector space. This notion will allow us to quickly establish many more examples of vector spaces.

    <title>Definition of a subspace</title>

  <definition xml:id="defn-subspace">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>U \subseteq V</m> of a vector space
        <m>V</m> is called a <term>subspace</term> of
        <m>V</m> if:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For all <m>\ve{u}, \ve{u}' \in U</m>,
              <m>\ve{u}+\ve{u}' \in U</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\ve{0} \in U</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For all scalars <m>k</m> and all vectors
              <m>\ve{u} \in U</m>,
              <m>k \smul\ve{u} \in U</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

<p>
    When <m>U</m> is a subset of a vector space
    <m>V</m>, then we can try to add two elements in <m>U</m>
    or try to multiply one element in <m>U</m> with a scalar
    as though they all were elements of <m>V</m>.
    Since these two operations are operations on
    <m>V</m>, the output will always be an element in <m>V</m>.
    But even if all the input elements are in the subset
    <m>U</m>, the outputs of these operations might not
    necessarily be in <m>U</m> (although they are definitely
    in <m>V</m>).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if <m>U</m> is a subspace, then these output
    values will be in <m>U</m> according to
    <xref ref="defn-subspace" text="type-global" />. In
    this case we say that the operations on <m>V</m>
    <term>restrict to</term> operations on <m>U</m>. In the
    following lemma we see that these restricted operations
    can be used to form the data that turns <m>U</m>,
    into a vector space.
  </p>
  <remark><p>
    Some textbooks will use the property in
    <xref ref="subspace_lem" text="type-global" />
    as the definition of a subspace and will then derive
    <xref ref="defn-subspace" text="type-global" />
    as a consequence.
  </p></remark>
  <remark><p>
    There is very little that distinguishes an operation
    on <m>V</m> from its restriction to <m>U</m>. Some
    people will even call these operations the same, because
    if you performed the operation on two elements from
    <m>U</m> you will get the same answer in both cases.
  </p></remark>

  <lemma xml:id="subspace_lem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>U</m> is a subspace of a vector
        space <m>V</m>. If we equip <m>U</m> with the
        restricted operations addition and scalar
        multiplication from <m>V</m>, then <m>U</m>
        is a vector space.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>U</m> is a subspace,
      we know that it actually makes sense to
      <q>equip it with the same addition operation,
      zero vector and scalar multiplication as in <m>V</m></q>.
      (If <m>U</m> was <em>not</em> a subspace,
      then we might have for instance
      <m>\ve{u}, \ve{u}' \in U</m> but <m>\ve{u}+\ve{u}' \notin U</m>,
      so the addition operation would not make sense.)
    </p>

    <p>
      So we simply need to check the rules R1 to R8.
      Since these rules hold for all vectors
      <m>\ve{u}, \ve{v}, \ve{w}</m> in <m>V</m>,
      they certainly hold for all vectors
      <m>\ve{u}, \ve{v}, \ve{w}</m> in <m>U</m>.
      So R1 to R8 are satisfied.

  <title>Examples of subspaces</title>

  <example>
    <title>Line in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m></title>
    <statement>
    <p>
      A line <m>L</m> through the origin in
      <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is a subspace of <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>:
    </p>
    <sidebyside>

      <caption>A line through the origin in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%">
      <latex-image>
        <![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[<->] (-2, 0) -- (2,0) node[below] {$x$};
        \draw[<->] (0, -2) -- (0, 2) node[right] {$y$};
        \draw[thick, red] (-2, -1) -- (2, 1) node[below] {$L$};\end{tikzpicture}]]>
      </latex-image>
      </image>
      </figure>
  </sidebyside>

    <p>
      Indeed, recall that <m>L</m> can be specified by
      a homogenous linear equation of the form:
      <men xml:id="eqn_of_L">
        L = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : ax + by = 0 \}
      </men>
      for some constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      So, if <m>\ve{v} = (x, \, y)</m> and
      <m>\ve{v}' = (x', \, y')</m> lie on <m>L</m>,
      then their sum
      <m>\ve{v} + \ve{v}' = (x + x', \, y + y')</m>
      also lies on <m>L</m>,
      because its components satisfy the defining equation
      <xref ref="eqn_of_L" text="global"/>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp a(x + x') + b (y + y')</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = (ax + by) + (ax' + by')</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 0 + 0 \amp \amp  \text{(since }ax + by = 0\text{ and }ax' + by' = 0)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This also makes sense geometrically:
      if you look at the picture
      <xref ref="line-through-origin-R2-example" text="global" />,
      then you will see that adding two vectors
      <m>\ve{v}, \ve{v}'</m> on <m>L</m> by the head-to-tail
      method will produce another vector on <m>L</m>.

    <title>Non-example: Line not through origin</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Be careful though <mdash /> not <em>every</em>
        line <m>L \subset \mathbb{R}^2</m> is a subspace of
        <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
        If <m>L</m> does not go through the origin,

      <p>
        Another reason that <m>L</m> is not a subspace is
        that it is not closed under addition:
        when we add two nonzero vectors <m>\ve{v}</m> and
        <m>\ve{v}'</m> on <m>L</m>,

      A <em>monomial</em> in two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is an expression of the form <m>x^m y^n</m> for some nonnegative integers <m>m,n</m>. The <em>degree</em> of the monomial is <m>m+n</m>. For example,
      <me>
        \underbrace{x^3 y^2}_{\text{degree 5}}, \quad \underbrace{y^7}_{\text{degree 7}}.
      </me>
      A <em>polynomial in two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m></em> is a linear combination of monomials. The <em>degree</em> of the polynomial is the highest degree of the monomials occuring in the linear combination. For instance,
      <men xml:id="two_var_poly_ex">
        p = 5x^3 y^2 - 3xy^7
      </men>
      is a polynomial in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> of degree <m>8</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We write <m>\Poly[x,y]</m> for the set of <em>all</em> polynomials in two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and <m>\Poly_n [x,y] </m> for the set of all polynomials in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can regard a polynomial <m>p</m> in two variables as a function
      <md>
        <mrow> p : \mathbb{R}^2 \amp \rightarrow \mathbb{R} </mrow>
        <mrow> (x,y) \amp \mapsto p(x,y) </mrow>
      </md>
      In this way, we can regard <m>\Poly_n[x,y]</m> as a subset of the vector space <m>\Fun(\mathbb{R}^2)</m> of <em>all</em> real-valued functions on <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> (see <xref ref="functions_on_set_vec_space"/> to remind yourself of the vector space of real-valued functions on a set <m>X</m>). Indeed, <m>\Poly_n[x,y]</m> is a <em>subspace</em> of <m>\Fun(\mathbb{R}^2)</m>, and hence it is a vector space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two polynomials <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> in variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are defined to be <em>equal</em> if and only if all their corresponding coefficients are equal. This is equivalent to the statement that <m>p(x,y)=q(x,y)</m> for all <m>(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, we can talk about 3-variable polynomials, and so on, eg.

       r = 5x^3y^2z + 3xy - 4xz^3 \in \Poly_6[x,y,z].

    Recall that a <em>vector field</em> on <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is just a vector whose components are functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. For example,
    <me>
      \ve{V} = (x^2 y, x \cos(y)).

    We write <m> \Vect_n (\mathbb{R}^2) </m> for the set of all vector fields

      \ve{V} = (xy, x^2y^3 - x) \in \Vect_5(\mathbb{R}^2).

    We define addition and scalar multiplcation for vector fields just as for ordinary vectors. That is, if <m>\ve{V} = (V_1, V_2) </m> and <m>\ve{W} = (W_1, W_2)</m> are vector fields on <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, then we define

      k \ve{V} = (k V_1, k V_2).

    The zero vector field is defined as the vector field whose components are the constant zero function:
    <me>
      Z = (0, 0)

    In this way, one can check that <m>\Vect_n (\mathbb{R}^2)</m> satisfies the rules of a vector space.

      <men xml:id="def_sum_subspace">
        U + V  = \{ \ve u + \ve w \in V \, : \, \ve u \in U, \ve w \in W \}
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the exercises below, <m>V,U,W</m> will be as above.
